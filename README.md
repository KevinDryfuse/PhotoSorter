# PhotoSorter
Sorts photos into a more meaningful structure

## Why does this exist
Our family takes a gazillion pictures across several devices and I don't have the time to sort through every photo and organize them properly.  I used to, but that was ridiculous so I decided to create a script that would scan a directory and its immediate child directories for photos, look at the date the photo was taken, and organize it accordingly. ````````

Once organized it should be for me to then drop these directories into my directory with all my other photos to be backed up to like a million different places.

## How do I make it work?
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python src/photosorter/main.py
